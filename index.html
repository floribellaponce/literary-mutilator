	<h3> All The Fools Sailed Away </h3>
	<p>There's perf ect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea. And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded
		by the things we'll do for promises and a song. We are the innocent, we are the damned. We were caught in the middle
		of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah. We bring you fantasy, we bring you pain. It's your one
		great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again. And all the fools sailed away all the fools
		sailed away sailed away. We bring you beautiful, we teach you sin. We can give you a piece of the universe or we will
		disappear never to return again. And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
		they sailed away sailed away. And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises
		and a song. We are the innocent, we cut we bleed. We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something
		you need. They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel. You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost
		like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah. And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away. All
		the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away. They say you're beautiful and
		they'll always let you in but doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away.

	<h3> The Sign Of The Southern Cross</h3>
	<p> If there isn't light when no one sees then how can I know what you might believe? A story told that can't be real
		somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah. Fade away, fade away. Vanish into smoke. Fade away, fade away. Break
		the crystal ball, oh! It's the sign feels like the time! On a small world, west of wonder somewhere, nowhere, oh.
		There's a rainbow that will shimmer when the summer falls. If an echo doesn't answer when it hears a certain sound
		Then the beast is free to wander but never is seen around and it's the sign of the southern cross. It's the sign of
		the southern cross all right. Sail away to the sign. Oh. From the book, the word is spoken whispers from forgotten
		psalms. Gather all around the young ones, they will make us strong.Reach above your dreams of pleasure giving life
		to those who died. Look beyond your own horizons. Sail the ship of signs and it's the sign of the southern cross.
		It's the sign of the southern cross. Fade away, fade away. Break the crystal ball. Fade away, fade away. I can't
		accept it anymore. Oh! On a real world, west of wonder somewhere, nowhere oh. There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
		when the summer falls. From the book, the word is spoken whispers from forgotten psalms. Gather all around the young
		ones, they will make us strong!. It's the sign of the southern cross. It's the sign of the southern cross. Don't live
		for pleasure. Make life your treasure. Fade away! Eight miles high, about to fall and no one there to catch you.
		Look for the sign, the time, the sign of the southern cross, yeah.

	<h3> TV Crimes </h3>
	<p> One day in the life of the lonely, another day on the round about. What do they need, somebody to love? One night in
		the life of the lonely there's a miracle on the screen. What did they see, somebody to love? He guarantees you instant
		glory. Get your money on the line. Gotta send me a plastic Jesus. There's a check in the mail today. That's what I
		need, somebody to love. We just won't eat on Sunday. Gotta buy him a limousine, somewhere to live, somewhere to pray.
		Every penny from the people keeps the wolf outside the door. Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself but he'll
		give you more, yeah. Holy father-holy ghost, who's the one who pays the most? Rock the cradle don't you cry. Buy
		another lullaby. Jack is nimble, Jack is quick. Pick your pocket, turn a trick. Slow and steady, he's got time to
		commit another TV crime, TV crime. One day in the life of the lonely, back again on the round about. What do they
		need, somebody to love? Yeah. One night in the life of the lonely, another miracle on the screen. What did they see,
		somebody to love again? A supermarket of salvation, take a look inside the store. Shop around and find forgiveness
		for yourself but he gives more. Holy father - holy ghost, who's the one who hurts you most? Rock the cradle when you
		cry. Scream another lullaby. Jack be nimble, Jack be slick. Take the money, get out quick. Slow and steady, so much
		time to commit another TV Crime, TV Crime. </p>
